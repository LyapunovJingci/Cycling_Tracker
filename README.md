# Cycling Tracker

Cycling Tracker is an Android app that helps a user to track exercising data and history. It shows and record instant data while cycling, and motivates the user when necessary. It stores exercising details, including but not limit to duration, track, highest speed, on Firebase backend, allowing a user to access his or her cycling history to discover patterns of personal exercing habits.  

## üßêFeatures 

* Show a dashboard of exercisng data, such as traveled distance, instant speed, altitude, etc..
* Provide a map, updating current location and track in real time.
* Provide a plot of cycling speed vs instant time. 
* Allow the user to modify units, font size, font type for better user experience.
* Motivate the user, if his or her current speed is lower than average history speed.
* Show statistical details of exercising, when the user ends tracking.
* Allow the user to rate a cycling track.
* Show a comprehensive detail of past exercising history.

The basic code structure of this demo was an one-month group project in the class "Principle of Software in Scale" at BU with four classmates, the link to our class project is [here](https://github.com/LyapunovJingci/Cycling_Tracker_EC500). Code refactoring was performed and several new features were added based on personal interest.
